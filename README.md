## Overview

The `Air/Airport.ipynb` notebook aims to help users understand various aspects of air traffic and airport operations. By processing and visualizing air traffic data, the notebook provides insights into:

- Flight frequency
- Peak traffic times
- Common routes
- Airport performance

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of air traffic data using charts and graphs
- Analysis of flight patterns and airport operations
- Customizable parameters for specific queries and visualizations

## Installation

To run this notebook locally, you'll need to set up your environment with the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NimaZahediN/Air.git
    cd Air
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Open `Air/Airport.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.

## Usage

Once the notebook is open, execute the cells step-by-step to process the data and generate visualizations. You can modify parameters within the notebook to customize the analysis according to your needs. 

Key sections in the notebook include:

- **Data Import**: Load the air traffic data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and format data appropriately.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs to visualize air traffic patterns.
- **Analysis**: Interpret the visualizations and derive insights.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is not included in the repository due to size constraints. You can use any public or proprietary air traffic dataset. Ensure that the dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV) and contains the necessary columns such as flight number, departure airport, arrival airport, departure time, and arrival time.
